    "- `r/TwoXChromosomes` (TwoX) is a feminist subreddit community that started in 2009. People interested in the topic found it by searching or following links that other people posted.\n",
    "- On May 7, 2014, it was made a \"default subreddit,\" which means people saw it on the front page of reddit. \n",
    "- A flood of new people went to the subreddit. They didn't know the community, and many of them didn't like feminism.\n",
    "    - Users of anti-feminist subreddits, in particular, were angry that a feminist subreddit made the list of defaults. \n",
    "- This was a big contraversy, both within reddit and in broader newsmedia.\n",
    "    - For example: \"[Reddit women protest at new front-page position](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/may/13/reddit-women-protest-front-page-subforum-subreddit-position)\"\n",
    "- We're going to investigate what happened using data from this subreddit.\n",

    "### 0.1 Topics\n",
    "- Changes in online communities over time\n",
    "- Changes in communities due to sudden events\n",
