    "Online communities can portray trends in current societal interests and discourse. With these communities being online, researchers are capable of easily analyzing and parsing through data to quantify these trends.  In this lab, we will be discussing way to measure changes in specific online communities on Reddit through scoring and comparison measures.  These scores have been generated by a variety of researchers through calculations and likelihood measures.  The specific calculations and scores will be detailed in the lab and more information can be found in the provided links.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will then plot trends in these online communities to get a better understanding of correlations and how time impacts user involvement.  Visualizing these trends through plotting will also lead into the following labs where we will go more in depth regarding community behavior.\n",

    "- Data files with Reddit comments are publicly available many places online, including torrents, google's BigQuery, and several data hosting websites. UM keeps a full copy in our Advanced Research Computing resources.\n",
    "- Reddit is one of the biggest sites on the internet. \n",
    "    - It has over 3.5 billion comments, and the data take up several TB of disk space (`1 TB = 1024 GB`)! \n",
    "    - This makes working with the data difficult.\n",
    "    - For simplicity, we went ahead and used some big data tools like `pyspark` and `hadoop` to go through all the comments and select out smaller sets to work with in this lab. \n",
    "- Let's start by looking at just the comments from the subreddit community for the University of Michigan\n",
    "    - This file is only 34 MB: a more managable size!\n",
    "    - The `shape` property tells us that there are 66 thousand rows (comments) and 28 columns."

    "## Section 2: Exploring Data\n",
    "### 2.1 Variables\n",
    "What information do we have about each comment?\n",
    "- We have a lot! Here are some of the most interesting columns:\n",
    "    - `body` the text of the comment\n",
    "    - `author` the username of the person who posted it\n",
    "    - `date` when the comment was made\n",
    "    - `subreddit` which community a comment is from. Here, they're all from `r/uofm`\n",
    "    - `politeness` scores, computed by the [Stanford NLP group's software](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Politeness.html), tell us how \"polite\" a comment is, from 0 (not at all) to 1 (very polite). The program that gives these scores was designed primarily for comments where someone was replying to a request.\n",
    "        - politeness scores are based on the indication of polite words, phrases, and communication strategies, instead of detecting impolite ones. In other words, 0 politeness does not necessarily mean impoliteness but lack of polite words.\n",
    "    - `sentiment` (how positive or negative a comment is), computed by the [VADER program in NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/sentiment/vader.html). (-1 is very negative, 0 is neutral, and 1 is very positive). \n",
    "        - VADER uses a bag of words approach, i.e. a lookup table of positive and negative words. Sentiment is calculated based on the occurrence of negative or positive words in texts, and the intensity of the sentiment will increase if words like “really”, “so” or “a bit” are present.\n",
    "    - `pej_nouns`: Sometimes when an adjective for people is used as a noun, it takes on a pejorative meaning. Research has found this is often true for the words \"female,\" \"gay,\" \"poor,\" and \"illegal,\" so this column counts the number of times those words (or versions of them like \"females\") are used as nouns. For more information, see this paper:\n",

    "    - Several scores from the [Perspective API](https://www.perspectiveapi.com/). In this project, Google and Jigsaw teamed up to build automatic systems for finding bad comments. We used their program to score these comments already, and the scores are saved in the file.\n",
    "        - `ATTACK_ON_COMMENTER` the probability that this comment is a personal attack on another commenter \n",
    "        - `INCOHERENT` whether the comment seems to make sense (high values don't make sense).\n",
    "        - `INFLAMMATORY` how inflammatory the comment is\n",
    "        - `LIKELY_TO_REJECT` the liklihood that New York Times comment editors would reject  the comment if it was posted on their site \n",
    "        - `OBSCENE` probability that the comment is obscene\n",
    "            - Obscene or vulgar language such as cursing.\n",
    "            - \"A higher score indicates a greater likelihood a reader would perceive the comment as containing the given attribute.\" (From [Perspective API](https://developers.perspectiveapi.com/s/about-the-api-model-cards))\n",
    "        - `TOXICITY` probability that the comment is 'toxic' for community discussion\n",
    "            - Perspective defines toxicity as \"a rude, disrespectful, or unreasonable comment that is likely to make you leave a discussion.\" (From [Perspective API](https://developers.perspectiveapi.com/s/about-the-api-model-cards))"

    "Getting a feel for our data\n",
    "- One of the first things to do with any data is plot it. We want to get a feel for what's in it and how it is spread out (i.e. how it is distributed). Take a look at the histograms below.\n",
    "- Below, we plot the distribution of sentiment scores and the distribution of obscentity scores.\n",

    "    - Sentiment ranges from -1 to +1. That is, people can make very negative or very positive comments, or anything in between.\n",
    "    - Sentiment looks like what we call a \"normal distribution\" or a \"bell curve.\" Most sentiment scores are around 0.2. Only a small number of comments have an extremely negative or extremely positive score.\n",
    "    - There is a big \"spike\" at 0 for sentiment. Usually, when you see a something like this in data is is a result of how the measurements were taken. In this case, comments get a score of 0 if they don't seem to have a positive or negative sentiment. For example:\n",
    "        - \"UM has too many students\" is negative.\n",
    "        - \"UM has 46,000 students\" is neither positive nor negative.\n",

    "        - \"It is amazing that we have such an excellent number of brilliant students\" is much more positive.\n",
    "    - Our obscenity score is different. It ranges from 0 to 1, and it has a spike at both extremes. That is because of how it was measured. The score is designed to answer a yes or no question: \"Is this obscene?\" If yes, it should give a score of 1, and if no, it should give a score of 0. When it is not sure, it gives a score in between. "
