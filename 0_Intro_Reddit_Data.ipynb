    "- Data files with Reddit comments are publicly available many places online, including torrents, google's BigQuery, and several data hosting websites. UM keeps a full copy in our Advanced Research Computing resources.\n",
    "- Reddit is one of the biggest sites on the internet. \n",
    "    - It has over 3 billion comments, and the data take up several TB of disk space (`1TB = 1024 GB`)! \n",
    "    - This makes working with the data difficult.\n",
    "    - For simplicity, we went ahead and used some big data tools like `pyspark` and `hadoop` to go through all the comments and select out smaller sets to work with in this lab. \n",
    "- Let's start by looking at just the comments from the subreddit community for the University of Michigan\n",
    "    - This file is only 34 MB: a more managable size!\n",
    "    - The `shape` property tells us that there are 66 thousand rows (comments) and 51 columns."
